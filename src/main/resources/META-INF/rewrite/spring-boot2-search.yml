displayName: Find projects affected by changes to the default error view message attribute
description: |
  As of Spring Boot 2.5 the `message` attribute in the default error view was removed rather than blanked when it is not shown.
  `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` projects that parse the error response JSON may need to deal with the missing item
  ([release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes#messages-in-the-default-error-view)).
  You can still use the `server.error.include-message` property if you want messages to be included.
